    "## What is a qumode?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bits are the world's simplest alphabet, allowing any piece of information to be represented using the characters 0 and 1. Qubits are an extension of the bit to quantum mechanics, allowing us to encode arbitrary quantum information with just the states $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$. But what if intead of two characters, the alphabet were infinite?\n",
    "\n",
    "A bosonic mode, or \"qumode,\" is an object that can contain any number of identical particles, each having the same energy. This endows the qumode with an infinite \"alphabet\" of states identified by the number of photons corresponding to that state, i.e. $|0\\rangle, |1\\rangle, |2\\rangle, |3\\rangle,...$, all the way to infinity. These states are formally referred to as \"Fock\" states.\n",

    "![A qubit has two distringuishable states, whereas an oscillator has infinitely many](./figures/energy_diagram.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure above shows the two mutually exclusive states of a qubit (a) compared with the infinitely many states of a qumode (b). The energies of the states of the qumode are evenly spaced because each particle contributes the same energy.\n",

    "## A note on Dirac notation\n",
    "You may be familiar with representing quantum states using matrices with complex coefficients, and if you are comfortable with Dirac notation you can skip this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dirac notation is another convenient way to represent quantum states. Dirac notation denotes a state by placing a label for the state between $|$ and $\\rangle$. Mutually exclusive states, such as states with different energies or a different number of photons, are assigned to orthogonal vectors. This allows us to easily go back and forth between matrix notation and Dirac notation. For example, using the mutually exclusive states $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$, \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\alpha |0\\rangle + \\beta |1 \\rangle \\ \\dot{=} \\ \\alpha \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\beta \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha \\\\ \\beta \\end{pmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "The funny $\\dot =$ sign is used to indicate that the choice of orthogonal vectors to assign to each state is arbitrary, so we could easily have made a different choice to assign $|0 \\rangle$ to $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix}$ and $|1\\rangle$ to $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dirac notation becomes particularly important for describing qumodes. With an infinite number of mutually exclusive states, the vectors would be infinitely long! The most general state $|\\psi\\rangle$ of a qumode can be written in the number basis as\n",
    "$$\n",
    "|\\psi\\rangle = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n |n\\rangle\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $a_n$ are complex numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## From qubits to qumodes\n",
    "Most of the familiar axioms for qubits generalize directly to qumodes. These are, briefly,\n",
    "1. Mutually exclusive states are orthogonal: if $m\\neq n$, then $|n\\rangle$ and $|m\\rangle$ correspond to a mode with two different photon numbers, making these states mutually exclusive. This implies that the states are orthogonal, meaning that their *inner product* vanishes: $\\langle m | n \\rangle = 0$. \n",
    "2. The Borne Rule: If $|\\psi\\rangle$ is the state of the resonator and $\\{|n\\rangle\\}$ is an orthonormal basis, then the probability of measuring $|\\psi\\rangle$ in the state $|n\\rangle$ is\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p_{\\psi}(n) = |\\langle n | \\psi \\rangle|^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "3. Normalization: The Borne rule implies that all physical quantum states should be normalized. In the case of a discrete basis like the Fock basis, this implies that $\\langle n | m \\rangle = \\delta_{mn}$. Vectors $|x\\rangle$ comprising a continuous basis generally do not represent physical states, and they are delta-function normalized, meaning that $\\langle x | x' \\rangle = \\delta(x-x')$.

    "## How do qubits and bosonic modes interact?\n",
    "At the heart of quantum computing with bosonic modes is the ability to make a qubit and a qumode interact. Just like both single- and two-qubit gates are necessary for universal control of a qubit, both Gaussian and non-Gaussian gates are necessary to control a qumode. For qubits that are not truly two-level systems, an anharmonic potential is necessary to isolate the first two energy levels. Non-Gaussian gates on a qumode are only possible because of the anharmonicity introduced by the qubit. The following shows what is meant by \"anharmonicity.\" The figure below shows the cosine potential and first five energy levels of a transmon qubit vs the quadratic potential and first five energy levels of a qumode. The difference between the first two energy levels is chosen to be the same on both. The quadratic potential of the qumode leads to evenly spaced energy levels, whereas the levels of the transmon are not evenly spaced. This plot was produced using [scQubits](https://scqubits.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n",

Qumodes can have mich higher quality factors than the qubits they are coupled to, making them ideal for storing information with a long lifetime. Gates on the qumode can be performed through the qubit. In addition, the state of the qubit is dependent on the state of the cavity, and so only the state of the qubit needs to be read out. "
