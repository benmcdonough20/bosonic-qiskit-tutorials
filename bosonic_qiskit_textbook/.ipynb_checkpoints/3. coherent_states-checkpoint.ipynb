    "## What is a coherent state?\n",
    "A coherent state $|\\lambda\\rangle$ is defined as an eigenstate of the annihilation operator $a$ with eigenvalue $\\lambda$. It seems like it would be a contradiction that after removing a photon from a state we could get the same state back, but the resolution to this apparent contradiction lies in the infinite number of states in the state space of the qumode. Setting up the eigenvalue equation for some arbitrary state $|\\psi\\rangle$,\n",

    "Equatin the coefficients on the $n = m$ state, we find that $c_{m} = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\sqrt{m}}c_{m-1}$. This means that $c_1 = \\lambda c_0$, $c_2 = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\sqrt{2}}c_1 = \\frac{\\lambda^2}{\\sqrt{2}}c_0$, and so on, arriving at the general formula $c_m = \\frac{\\lambda^m}{\\sqrt{m!}}c_0$.
