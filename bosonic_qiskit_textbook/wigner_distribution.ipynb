    "The Wigner distribution is an important tools for visualizing quantum states, and it is especially useful for visualizing the states of qumodes. As discussed in `operations.ipynb`, the Hamiltonian of a qumode is readily written down in terms of the operators $x$ and $p$, which satisfy the canonical commutation relationship $[x,p] = -i\\hbar$, making them conjugate phase space variables. We also saw that the expectation values $\\langle x\\rangle$ and $\\langle p \\rangle$ of a coherent state behave just like the classical solutions to a harmonic oscillator, and in the large $\\lambda$ limit, the variance of both $x$ and $p$ stay constant, becoming small in comparison to their means. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is suggestive of the correspondence between the classical phase space variables and the conjugate quantum operators. The biggest problem is that due to the uncertainty principle, there are no simulatneous eigenstates of postition and momentum to serve as an analogue to classical coordinates. The eigenstates of $x$ and $p$ form a continuous basis, and hence are not physically realizable states. \n",
    "\n",
    "A solution to these problems would be to come up with a probability distribution $W_\\psi(x, p)$ such that the marginals of the distribution produce the probability distributions of $x$ and $p$ given by the Borne rule:\n",

    "## The Weyl Transformation\n",
