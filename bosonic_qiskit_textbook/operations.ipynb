    "A bit-flip is the obvious operation on a classical bit which is either in the state $0$ or $1$. In addition to the bit value, qubit states also exhibit a phase in the form of a complex scalar multiplying each basis ket. A bit-flip operation on a qubit is described by a $\\sigma^x$ operator. Phase-flips are performed with $\\sigma^z$. A rotation of the qubit by any degree $\\theta$ about any axis $\\hat n$ can be described using these operations alone. Defining the pseudovector $\\vec \\sigma \\equiv (\\sigma^x, i\\sigma^x\\sigma^z, \\sigma^z)$, the operator performing this rotation is\n",

    "If bit-flips and phase-flips are the basic operations we can do to a qubit, what can we do to a qumode? Oftentimes the states of an qumode marching up to infinity are compared to a ladder, where adding a photon to the qumode climbs one rung up the ladder, and removing a photon climbs one rung down the ladder. This motivates us to introduce the so-called *ladder operators* $a$ and $a^\\dagger$. The $a$ is called the annihilation operator because it removes a photon from the qumode, and the $a^\\dagger$ operator is the creation operator because it adds a photon to the qumode. \n",

    "**Note:** The ${}^\\dagger$ operation is called the adjoint. This is simple to define in the finite-dimensional space of a qubit, but can become tricky in the infinite-dimensional space of an oscillator, in particular because operators can be unbounded and may not have an adjoint! We deal with this using the following definition: If $O$ is an operator, $|u\\rangle$ and $|v\\rangle$ are kets, and $\\Big\\langle |u\\rangle, |v\\rangle \\Big\\rangle = \\langle v | u\\rangle$ is the inner product of $|u\\rangle$ and $|v\\rangle$, then $O^\\dagger$ is the adjoint of $O$ iff $\\Big\\langle O^\\dagger|u\\rangle, |v\\rangle \\Big\\rangle = \\Big\\langle |u\\rangle, O|v\\rangle \\Big\\rangle$. Shortly, we will *force* the creation operator to be the adjoint of the annihilation operator, but for now we can just consider $a^\\dagger$ to be a variable name."
