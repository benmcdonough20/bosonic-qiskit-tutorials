    "A bit-flip is the obvious operation on a classical bit which is either in the state $0$ or $1$.

    "If bit-flips and phase-flips are the basic operations we can do to a qubit, what can we do to a quantum harmonic oscillator? Oftentimes the states of an oscillator marching up to infinity are compared to a ladder, where adding a photon to the oscillator climbs one rung up the ladder, and removing a photon climbs one rung down the ladder. This motivates us to introduce the so-called *ladder operators* $a$ and $a^\\dagger$. The $a$ is called the annihilation operator because it removes a photon from the oscillator, and the $a^\\dagger$ operator is the creation operator because it adds a photon to the oscillator. \n",
