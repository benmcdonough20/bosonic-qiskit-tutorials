# Bosonic Qiskit Textbook

## Forward
This textbook presents a zero-to-sixty introduction to continuous-variable quantum computing. The intended audience has experience with quantum computing using qubits at the level of the [Qiskit Textbook](https://qiskit.org/textbook/preface.html) but is not assumed to have any previous experience with physics. The textbook is intended to be self-contained, in that mathematical formulas and quantum mechanics concepts are always introduced alongside proofs or guided exercises used to establish the facts when the proofs break the flow of the text. The guide mixes together the core concepts of quantum computing using bosonic modes with code examples from Bosonic Qiskit wherever appropriate. 

A few choices were made in this textbook which will hopefully express the necessary concepts more succinctly:

First, in the discussion of harmonic oscillators, many quantum mechanics textbooks first present the classical Hamiltonian and then go through the procedure of quantizing it. Instead, we take the approach of first conceptualizing the quantized state space of a qumode, then we introduce the creation and annihilation operators, and finally, we use these relations to arrive at the oscillator Hamiltonian in phase-space variables. The correspondence limit is then explored further using coherent states. The rationale is that from a computer science perspective, the physical details are often not as important to understand. 

Second, the Baker-Campbell-Hausedorff Lemma is used, but the full identity is avoided along with the Dynkin formula and other related expressions. These are more difficult to prove and the computations tend to be longer. Instead, the Heisenberg equation of motion is proven without explicitly referencing the Schr√∂dinger equation, and this is used to derive facts about many of the different gates that appear in Bosonic Qiskit.

Last, the uncertainty principle is derived as a general fact about the variances of noncommuting observables without referring directly to phase-space variables.

This work was produced by the Bosonic Qiskit project group under the Yale undergraduate Quantum Computing group, consisting of Ben McDonough, Jeb Cui, and Gabriel Marous. Writing this was an incredible learning experience. We found the richest and most helpful source for quantum optics to be **Introductory Quantum Optics** by Gerry and Knight, which we recommend if you are interested in learning more. This project was supervised by Prof. Steven M. Girvin and Kevin Smith.

## Structure
This textbook in its current form is divided into five parts:

### Introduction
An introduction to the state space of bosonic modes. Comparison between qubits and continuous-variable systems. Physical examples of bosonic modes. Importing Bosonic Qiskit and creating a simple circuit.

### Operations
Ladder operators, the number operator, quadrature operators, and phase-space operators. Outer products and exponentials of operators. Working with continuous spectra.

### Coherent States
Definition and representation in the number basis. Photon number distribution. Overlap of two coherent states. Derivation of the uncertainty principle and coherent states as minimum-uncertainty states. Time-evolution of a coherent state and correspondence with the Harmonic oscillator.

### Wigner Distributions
Introduction and motivation for considering Wigner distributions. Weyl quantization and recovering the trace from the Weyl transformation. The Wigner function as a Weyl transformation of the density matrix. Properties of the Wigner function including normalization, negativity, and real-valuedness. More generalized discussion of minimum-uncertainty states as Gaussians and a derivation of the Wigner function of a minimum-uncertainty state.

### Gates
The Baker-Campbell-Hausedorff Lemma and Heisenburg's equations of motion. Discussion of the properties of Gaussian gates including the following:

* Phase space rotation
* Displacement
