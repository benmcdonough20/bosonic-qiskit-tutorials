## Tutorial topics:

### "Qiskit Textbook" for Bosonic Qiskit
Introductory chapter emulating the Qiskit textbook with the basic concepts and some code examples needed to get familiar with Bosonic Qiskit.

Potential outline for tutorial:

* Introduction: From the computational basis to Fock space
  * Light justification appealing to the physics of oscillators
  * Infinite-dimensional objects
  * Truncation level and statevectors
* Operators
  * Creation / Annihilation operators
  * x and p operators?
  * Number operator
* Wigner quasiprobability distribution
  * How to view the state of an oscillator
  * Interpreting negative probabilities
* Coherent states
* Gates
* JC Hamiltonian

## Tutorial goals
* Explain each line of code in each tutorial more deeply
* Guide the reader through the code with a clear outline of what each section of code does
